Analyse _includes/sidebar.html to understand how .lagda.md files should be structured. 

I'm am going to start adding .lagda.md files to src/definitions. 

At the moment, for each definition I provide, create a separate .lagda.md file.

After creating a definition use agda to compile to ensure the definition is correct.

Avoid the use of levels. Instead just use Set and Set‚ÇÅ etc.

Ensure to check other definitions in the definitions folder. Always prefer a definition in this folder over a standard library construct.

Do not overbuild the definition. Keep it as simple as possible while still adhering to the text.

New modules must be added to src/Everything.agda
